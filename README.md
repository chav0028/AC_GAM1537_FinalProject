Using a Windows Application, we were tasked to create a 2D game, using GDI+ to render the game. For this project, I created a defense game where you have to shoot the different aliens trying to attack your base.

Some of the features in the game were:
* Basic game loop in Windows Application, used to update, render and get user's input
* Rendering of sprites using GDI+
* Circle-to-circle and rectangle-to-rectangle collisions
* Different enemy types with different stats and movement style
* Health and damage system
* Game over screen when health reaches 0, showing the player's final score
